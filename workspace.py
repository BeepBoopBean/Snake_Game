# to do:
#
# create snake:
# three blocks behind each other:
#     place one block at coords
#     set for each appended block to be - however many coords
#
# motion:
#     always moving in whatever direction it is facing
#     listen to keys to turn left or right
#     when it is told to turn, first block to turn, then each following block to turn in that direction after however
#     many coordinates
#
# points:
#     have a dot appear at random coordinates
#     whenever the first block enters that coordinate, get a point and append a block to the snake
#
# game over:
#     if the first block enters coordinates of another block, game over

# make an easy, med, or hard mode with the snake moving at different speeds

# at start of game, just start playing in default mode; defaults to pink and normal speed.
# see mode options by hitting "m"
# difficulties = speed of snake
# on modes menu, it would be cute if I could have snakes/turtles moving in an already-defined pattern at the
# different speeds
# party mode: random colors on snake segments/change every point?
# jungle mode: greens, and it eats turtles
# boring mode: black and white
# original: pink and white

# At end of game if they choose to quit, display their best score in the run
#
# It would be good if the food could not land on the same space the snake currently  on
